This is a Proof-of-concept React.js app that uses our `legislative-rtree` library entirely in a web browser demonstrating no need to call an API for legislative info. All processing happens client side, and all data pulled is static content hosted by a CDN.

If someone could take this and make a really awesome website, that would be great!
